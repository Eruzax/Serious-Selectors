      <h2>Game Play</h2>
      <p>Checkers is played by two players.</p>
      <p>Black opens the game, then players alternate their turns.</p>

      <h2>Move</h2>
      <p>The pieces always move diagonally and single pieces are always limited to forward moves.</p>
      <p>A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.</p>

      <h2>Capture</h2>
      <p>To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.</p>
      <p>When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.</p>
      <p>Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.</p>
      <p>If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.</p>
      <p>If more than one capture is available, then the player decides if he prefers this or not.</p>
      <p>Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</p>

      <h2>Upgrade a piece to a King</h2>
      <p>When a piece reaches the furthest row, it is crowned and becomes a king.</p>
      <p>One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.</p>
      <p>Kings are limited to moving diagonally but can move both forward and backward.</p>
      <p>Kings may combine jumps in several directions (forward and backward) on the same turn.</p>
      
      <h2>End of the Game</h2>
      <p>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move.</p>
      <p>This happens usually because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.</p>
